# Monte-Carlo-Simulations-on-SBA-15
Monte Carlo Simulations for the Propane Gas on SBA15 pore to understand the capillary Condensation process. We built the SBA15 pore using PoreMS a python based tool. Then we did the Monte Carlo Simulations using Cassandra to understand the phase behavior and adsorption process of propane gas on SBA15 with Grand Canonical Ensemble.
